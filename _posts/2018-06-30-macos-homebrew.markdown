I'm setting up the new macbook slowly for everyday programming needs, thought I'd document some of the steps along the way so I don't have to search the internet all over again next time.

On my old laptop I have used MacPorts and remembered that it gave me a lot of headaches trying to manage what is what. After reading some articles comparing the package managers for macOS I decided to go with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). If you are interested in the difference between them and need some help with deciding on which to install, here is a [link to a discussion on quora](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-use-Fink-MacPorts-Homebrew-or-something-else-for-MacOS-package-management-Which-are-most-popular-currently-Are-there-any-newer-players-worth-preferring-such-as-Rudix). Also another link discussing the [packages](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-first-or-must-have-homebrew-packages-that-you-install-on-your-Mac) you might want to install after you install homebrew.

Installing homebrew is very easy, simply run this command: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.
