**Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Design Principles
* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

### To refresh
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Interface (programming to an interface)
